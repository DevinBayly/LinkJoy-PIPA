## About the Author 

When Brian Bayly was fifteen a teacher told him, “You have ideas that are different from other people's. In later life, don't feel awkward or unhappy about that.” It was a perceptive remark: in a life in science, Bayly has rarely worked at the frontier; his contributions have come from taking a fresh look far back at the basics of a field of study --- in mineralogy, thermodynamics and now the human brain. “Discovery consists of seeing what everybody has seen and thinking what nobody has thought." 

Bayly grew up in England but has worked in the Arctic, the Antarctic, Australia and New Guinea. His spell as a volcano observer prompted the remark: “That prepared him for marriage to Helen” --- while volcanoes are active, wives display activism. Married in Australia, Brian and Helen have raised children and grandchildren in the United States; their principal home is in upstate New York. Brian's perceptions about humans come partly from his children's places of work --- universities, the U. S. Treasury and a zoo. Students, economists and chimpanzees all contribute to his ideas on what people enjoy.
