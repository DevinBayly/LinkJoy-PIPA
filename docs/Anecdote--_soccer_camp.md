## Anecdote: soccer camp 

Some years ago, my son wanted to spend a week at soccer camp and the decision had to come from me. On a Monday night I lay awake considering alternatives; if he went, he would gain such and such benefits whereas in an extra week at home we could give him such and such others. I had in mind a string of desirable qualities in a young boy &mdash; honesty, initiative, self-reliance, kindness etc. &mdash; and looked for a course of action whose outcome would match some of these. Eventually I thought of a course of action that gave a good match; link-joy descended and I fell asleep. 

But Tuesday brought a new challenge. On waking, I had in mind the course of action I favored and the conjectural benefits in view, but my inner voice could not find suitable words. I needed a phrase that matched my intent but that would also carry weight with my son; I wanted the words he heard to have meaning for him, I wanted him to find that the words matched some idea in his mind that he already understood; in short, I wanted rapport. On Monday I sought link-joy for myself, and on Tuesday I sought link-joy for my son. 

Situations like the one just described lie behind such everyday phrases as: 

â€œI didn't know enough to figure out all the consequences; I had to do just what *felt* right at the time ..."

If an action feels right, that is because it matches some idea or belief already in one's mind, and one can see here also how link-joy events accumulate. A long-range purpose can only be pursued through short range decisions, and most of these are made by matching. If, over and over, one does what matches or feels right, there is a good chance that one's long-range goal will be met. The poet Schiller wrote that joy drives the wheels of the great clock of the world, and in that image one can conceive a big wheel driven by a whole train of little wheels. Schiller was right: link-joy drives the little wheels and, cumulatively, long-range consequences emerge.
