## Anecdote: Marza and Anju 

One evening I watched my daughter on the stage. She is of slender build and from high in the rear of the auditorium where I sat, her slightness was accentuated. But at that pregnant moment when the house lights dim and the stage lights come on, her voice piped up well: *“What country, friends, is this?"*

The play was Twelfth Night with the scenes shuffled. She was defenseless, shipwrecked on an unknown shore, but with companions --- secure despite insecurity. Just five words encompassed all this. 

On a related occasion I sat in a high shadowed Gothic building whose west door was open. Out of the night, the voice of a single choir boy came clear as a bell, *"Once in royal David's city..."*

And in the second movement of Mendelssohn's violin concerto, the theme arrives solo: *T-a-a-a ta-ta-ta t-a-a-a ...*

These are goosebump moments, they have that quality in common. But the middle one has a religious background, the first does not, and the third, who knows? Mendelssohn had beliefs but we do not know how far they inspired his music, and for sure, his melody works its magic on the faithful and faithless alike. So what is going on? For people of faith, their “highest concepts exist within the framework of their beliefs, but presentiments of some kind of high ideal are found in ungodly people as well. It's a puzzle: where do the goosebumps fit in, what is their role? Are they a mainspring or just an ornament on the outside of the fabric of life? 

Just last week presented a different angle: I went to a wedding conducted according to some unfamiliar rites. Indeed, much of the ceremony was in an unfamiliar language and the religion of the participants was one in which I do not believe. 

I have known Marza and Anju for several years, we often share meals and have spent days camping together; listening to the wind and watching the moon rise, I imagined that their thoughts were somewhat parallel to my own. But then they married. They are serious young people, I am sure they made their vows with every devout intent, but the god they invoked was a fiction to me. The friends who admired the same moon --- I brushed the underpinning of their lives and found it not only different, I found it wrong, inconceivable; what they firmly believed in seemed to me plain hooey. 

Yet we did admire the same moon; within limits, we love the same Shakespeare and are moved by the same tunes. Are these goosebump experiences more universal than religions? Where religions divide, are there some experiences that unite? Well, of course there are low-level experiences that unite: we all eat and drink. But are there high-level experiences, do we have “sublime moments” that are roughly the same all over the world? 

Hard questions, tough sledding! But there is an easier thought that steps us toward an answer. It is the season for gifts, and I plan to give Anju a golf club and Marza a book. Or so it appears --- but those are a means, not an end; my objective is to give them both golden moments. 

The book is not a page-turner, it is poems and I hope it is more of a heart-stopper. I hope Marza will once or twice be seized, brought to a standstill by what she reads. And Anju, I hope he will once or twice connect with the “sweet spot." Each of them will sense, “That's exactly right!” And some reader in Korea will have such a moment too, and some ball-player in Peru. Such moments of connection are worldwide, enjoyed by everyone, they cross all borders. 

There is a more prominent world feature: fear. Politicians promote it, news media exploit it, even the world of neuroscience (for different reasons) gives more attention to fear than to joy. So who specializes in joy? Why, we the people! That small joy, from a golf stroke or a poem, is the young cousin of the most intense joys we ever feel. Among sounds, there is a continuum from a shout down to the faintest of murmurs, and joy-from-connecting ranges similarly from the heart-stopping to the almost subconscious; the intense moments that everyone notices are the tip of a vast iceberg. And this worldwide iceberg deserves our attention because although I don't share the religion of Marza and Anju, I share their link-joys.
