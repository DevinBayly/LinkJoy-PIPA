## Chapter 2 How does this fit with mainstream cognitive science? 

* Generalists

* Inward and outward signals

* Summary 

An earlier section, in the Introduction, listed precursors of the idea I am putting forward, not many in number. By contrast, here I look (amazed) at the vast number of people who have written about brains without mentioning this idea. But I will comment on only two groups: first, well-known generalists; second, Erich Harth, Jeff Hawkins and Joaquin Fuster &mdash; bound together by a common interest in the meeting of inward signals and outward signals in the brain. The topic of consciousness has recently been fashionable and has produced a spate of writing but this is mostly not quite relevant; for reasons, see Chapter 5. 

### Generalists 

Interested readers have had the pleasure of a steady flow of great books. Although it was not the first, let's start with The Astonishing Hypothesis by Francis Crick, published in 1994. The hypothesis is that the brain is a mechanism worked by chemicals and electrically charged particles that we can understand by looking and thinking; a person can use his brain to inspect his brain. Somewhere here one gets trapped in an endless progression: can one think about thoughts about thoughts...? But certainly one's whole brain can inspect the workings of some parts of the brain; one of my sons studies brains and is sometimes his own test-animal. And Crick's hypothesis is that in principle the job will mostly get done; we will eventually be able to explain much of how we think and feel. Well, most writers agree that that day is still far off, but progress is being made and there are many astute commentators on the state of play. Here are four that catch the eye: 

How does this fit with mainstream cognitive science! 

Antonio Damasio 
* *Looking for Spinoza* 2003 

* *The Feeling of What Happens* 2000 

* *Descartes' Error* 1994 

William Calvin 

* *A Brief History of the Mind* 2004 
* *How Brains Think* 1996 
* *Conversation with Neil's Brain* 1995 

Steven Pinker 

* *The Blank Slate* 2003 
* *How the Mind Works* 1999 

Melvin Konner 

* *The Tangled Wing 2nd ed.*  2002 

Konner names 185 people in his Acknowledgments (is this a record?) and the other authors are also quite well connected. I recall a rhyme about Benjamin Jowert, an earlier specialist in how human beings work: 

I live here and my name's Jowett;

If it's knowledge then I know it.

I am the Master of this college;

What I don't know isn't knowledge. 

Nowadays people's claims to omniscience are more limited but if Konner, Pinker, Calvin and Damasio were ever in the same room, they might claim about the brain's major principles that between them they had the field pretty well covered. (I am looking here at people who write for the general public, not the great expositors in the more technical literature.) The upshot is that nothing in these fine overviews conflicts with what I am emphasizing &mdash; they just don't mention it. For example, enjoying jokes gets mentioned in a few places and enjoying music gets mentioned too, in other places. But the need for a mechanism to generate the pleasure and the possibility that a single mechanism underlies such a wealth of human motivations are not recognized. 

Perhaps the closest that these books come to the link-joy proposal is with assertions such as "People are driven to seek patterns" or "Pattern seeking seems to be innate." Here the word pattern is used because it can be extended beyond its narrow sense into music, rhyme, dancing, mathematics and so on. And to say that people are driven" is meant to suggest something that they do for internal rather than external reasons. Thus these assertions are groping toward the link-joy proposal, but only toward part of it. 

One might expect more from The Brain and Emotion, a great synthesis by Edmund Rolls. But what has been studied is the effect of emotion on how the brain works, as when an excited person "doesn't think straight." Events not covered are those when emotion is the consequence, not the cause, of brain activity &mdash; as with the link-joy I describe here. Every human eye has a blind spot and people who study brains seem to have a blind spot too. The present proposal and these great overviews are perfectly compatible but they lie side by side without touching. 

### Inward and Outward Signals 

Moving on, the books I refer to by Erich Harth and Jeff Hawkins are, respectively, The Creative Loop and On Intelligence (written with Sandra Blakeslee). Harth's subtitle is broad &mdash; How the brain makes a mind - -- and Hawkins too has an ambitious sweep, but the key idea in both books is the same: our eyes, ears etc. generate signals that travel inward or upward, but the signals meet and interact with signals traveling downward or outward. To catch the process in slow motion, recall an occasion when you saw an object but could not tell at once what it was. For example, once I was sitting at a sidewalk table in a street with trees. An object caught my eye, something quite high among the branches of a tree across the street; was it a bird, a cat, a nest or something more accidental? Sometimes a hat gets stuck in a tree, having been thrown by the owner out of joy or by a prankster out of mischief, and sometimes even more surprising things. But the object I saw was rather small for a cat and rather large for a bird, yet it seemed to be resting rather than hanging &mdash; I got no sense that it was hanging limply as a wooly hat might do. It was a puzzle: I could see pale and dark parts but for some time could not discern a head or tail or any definite feature. Eventually a small motion revealed a tail, and at once the whole puzzle resolved &mdash; it was a small cat; its head was just drooping down in a way that made it hard to see. 

Now consider: what process is going on during the period of uncertainty? One's brain is looking for a match. The first signals from the eye are ambiguous and start the brain thinking of possibilities. The brain thinks "Cat?" and sends outward some notions of what cats can look like; it also thinks "Har?" and sends out signals about hats. "Looking more closely" amounts to sending inward more specific information and sending outward more specific possibilities. Eventually inward and outward lock together: one realizes, "It's a cat; that pale patch is its ear." 

A more famous example is summed up in the words almost everyone knows, "It's a bird! It's a plane! It's Superman!" In such an instance of uncertainty, as just described, the process is long-drawn out and the pleasure of matching is mixed with pleasure from relief of tension. But in "instantaneous recognition" there is the same two-way traffic. One's brain uses past experience of cats and birds just as much as it uses incoming signals from the eye. Usually the process is too quick for us to be conscious of it and no tension builds up, but any act of recognition yields a tiny pleasure. Harth and Hawkins provide all kinds of depth and details &mdash; they just miss mentioning the last bit, the pleasure. It was the writer John McCrone who drew attention to that. 

Both Harth and Hawkins are fully familiar with computing and software. (The computing strategy "winner take all" refers to the moment when the situation clarifies, one idea beats the competition, and all other possibilities are totally thrown out. This process can be handily modeled on a computer.) By contrast Joaquin Fuster's specialization is wetware, a real brain. His lifelong study has been the composition and working of the cortex, that soft frontal and outer part that is most distinctive of humans. But beside knowing what the cortex is, Fuster has considered carefully what it does. At least since Socrates, people have been puzzling over that and here are Fuster's conclusions: 

"Perception is the classing of the world into categories.  and The categorizing that forms the percept is essentially a matching act.... " 
These meaty assertions are worth unpacking. 

*"Perception is the classing of the world into categories."* When I looked across the street and was puzzled, I did not at first perceive a cat. But once I classed what I could see into the category cat" 1 perceived it clearly. Fuster might have written, "Perception is the classing of everything in one's field of view into categories &mdash; house, tree, cat etc." This would have led up to his more dramatic assertion. 

*"The categorizing that forms the percept is essentially a matching act."* The jump from a confused jumble to a clearly perceived cat depends on my having seen cats before. I possessed the general idea of a cat from prior experience and eventually matched the colored patches with that idea. Other people agree about the matching: "... our perception of an apple is not just based on the integration of shape and form ... but also on the integration of these features with information stored in memory ..." &mdash;J. LeDoux. Or "... perception is the top-down interpretation of the world in the light of prior experience" &mdash;E. G. Boring. But it was the onlooker John McCrone who noted the third element, "the physiological click that follows the matching" and "floods the brain with pleasurable feelings." 

The essential role of categories in language is discussed in Chapter 4. But they lead to more than language: "The categorization of human knowledge ... is the essence of all cognitive functions" &mdash; that is Fuster again; only the italics are by me. 

It is amazing how many people have come so close to McCrone's point (and mine) without hitting it. Is it that scientists are cold and unemotional? Absolutely not. It is not that scientists are unemotional but when doing science they tend to filter emotions out or set them aside. The situation is changing; there is now a journal Cognition and Emotion, and someone else may make my point before this book gets into print. As a last example of how close orthodox neuroscience has already come, here is a line from a report on some recent experiments by Dr. Axel Mecklinger and associates: 

"... suggesting that either an internal reward or an expectancy-confirmation mechanism accompanied correct ... judgments." 

An "internal reward" means a moment of mental pleasure or joy. If they had written "... an internal reward *arising from* an expectancy confirmation mechanism ..." they would have been on the money. 

I certainly don't instantly read everything that is written and I have not got 185 associates helping to keep me up to date. Perhaps by now these remarks have been overtaken by events. 

### Summary 

I have seen nothing in recent neuroscience to conflict with the proposal in this book. Instead, the recent trend is for specialists' discoveries to come closer and closer to supporting the present conjecture. Who knows how soon the conjecture will appear in the orthodox neuroscience or cognitive-science journals, and what reception it will get when it does?
