## Introduction 
Let me begin by telling the main idea: Pleasure arises in your brain 
It may begin with a taste on your tongue or a sound in your ear, but it is inside your brain that the pleasure is sensed. To check this, suppose you are asleep when I put a drop of sweet fruit juice on your tongue. Unless the action wakes you, you feel no pleasure --- to sense pleasure you need a conscious brain. 
And the pleasure-sensor can be set off by two things matching. 
An example is rhyme: “The cat in a hat” is a livelier title than “The cat on a rug." And a pair of shoes that match give an effect that we don't get from two odd shoes --- an effect that, though small, is real. 
The main idea is that this pleasure from matching pervades our lives. The air we breathe is little-noticed but essential, and pleasure from matching is the same. We get it in such a constant stream that it goes unnoticed, but everything we do that is different from chimpanzees has pleasure from matching as a part. Of all the differences that make us human, getting pleasure from matching may be the most essential; we would not be human without it and it shapes each life from birth to death, from beginning to end. 
“Nonsense!" you say, “I get pleasure from going to a party, watching a ball-game, swimming ..." 
Of course! To enjoy yourself is to be animated, jolly, with zest; it isn't brainwork. My point is that even without doing brainwork, still the pleasure you get comes from your brain, not from your eyes or your fingers. Your brain is constantly delivering pleasure and to know something about the process might be a benetis 
Immediately, questions arise: 
* If things that match are so important, why hasn't someone said so before? 
*  Who is this writer, some kind of oddball? Must I take him seriously? 

But first, is this pleasure from matching all that important? Rhymes and shoes are fairly small concerns. Before going farther, let's look at something more consequential, conversation. 

a: “You remember Chris from last Friday?" 

b: "Yes, in that eye-catching shirt.” 

a: "Almost a technicolor dreamcoat, wasn't it?" 

b:“Yes, I almost called him Joseph ..." 

or else: 

a: "You remember Chris from last Friday?" 

b: “The fellow who played the piano?” 

a: “No, the person in the fancy shirt.” 

b: “Fancy shirt? I don't remember any ..." 

The first two talkers are on the same wavelength, enjoying rapport. Both know the old title Joseph and his amazing technicolor dreamcoat and whenever one made an allusion, the other picked it up. By contrast, the second conversation was going nowhere; the second pair would soon drift apart dissatisfied. Now this difference runs deep. Think of your friends: who is a real friend? --- someone who, when you say something, knows what you are talking about. With a friend, conversation is a pleasure. And the reason is that when Pat or Chris makes a remark, you can find in your own mind a meaning that matches their words. 

Another part of conversation is your own remarks, finding the right phrase. When you can't find suitable words it is frustrating and disappointing, but when you succeed you feel pleasure. Now this is different from shoes and rhymes --- speech for a community is like electricity for a town; speech is the power-current throughout human life. If it is true that speaking and hearing run on pleasure-from matching, that pleasure indeed lies deep. It is the warp and weft of the fabric of our lives, or of our mental lives at least. 

Let us then return to the questions, If it is so important, why haven't we heard about it before? And, is this writer off his head or on the level? Short answers are (1) it has been almost pointed out before, and (2) I in person am as ignorant and muddleheaded as anyone. But when I focus on this particular idea, it is hard to find any weakness in it: 

We do converse

We do enjoy conversation

The pleasure does come partly from matching 

The matching is done in our brains 

Our brains generate pleasure from other kinds of matching too 
(in music, sport, science and art as well as rhymes and shoes).

Indeed, the pleasure is like the drops of rain in a rain-storm: each individual drop is tiny but they are so numerous, they drench the world. The pleasure from infinitely numerous tiny matchings adds up to one of the great influences in our lives. 

To cover the first question I will look briefly at some previous writers, the antecedents. To cover the second, I will put a simple list of 35 points at which the effect enters our lives. No-one needs to read all of these --- different people have different interests. One need only look at enough of these to be satisfied that the effect is indeed pervasive. Then, assuming the reader wishes to go further, I will return to the table of contents for what follows. Let's not forget that pleasure is the topic. I have found gathering these notions endlessly beguiling and I hope to arrange them so that the reader too enjoys the journey. To this end, I have interspersed jokes, quotations and boxes with anecdotes, but the busy reader can ignore these; the essentials are in the main text.
