## Prologue 
In Achoo village, life was a struggle: the land was not fertile, rainfall was insufficient, diseases were endemic and outsiders occasionally raided. The one redeeming feature was the coti: treats appeared on people's doorsteps by no visible means, often trivial but occasionally substantial. Everyone in the village received coti, sometimes several times a day in a wide variety of forms &mdash; it was part of what made their lives bearable. The puzzling aspect (apart from the coti themselves) was that no-one in Achoo was at all curious about where the coti came from. The villagers enjoyed the treats &mdash; indeed their lives were shaped by them &mdash; but wondered Why? no more than they wondered why there were leaves on the trees ... .

We in the cities of the new millenium are like the villagers of Achoo. Each person enjoys a stream of treats every day from an unknown source, and yet we have been amazingly incurious. This disregarded stream is the subject of the book.
