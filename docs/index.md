### Our Joyful Minds 
#### Where does satisfaction come from? 
*"nothing inspirational&mdash; just down-to-earth sense"*

*"Brian Bayly has noticed, and points out in the simplest terms, a feature of the human mind that everybody enjoys but no-one else has cottoned onto. When younger, he traveled in empty lands &mdash; he led the only party that has ever penetrated Antarctica’s “Forbidden Plateau.” In this book he is in the midst of the human crowd but still breaking new ground. Others have noticed separate details but Bayly sees the whole elephant."*
*Readers will learn something about themselves and about what we enjoy, about Yasmin (with freckles) and about Anju who makes bad coffee. The lively writing animates a wholly serious and well-researched account of a source of pleasure that should have been recognized decades ago. The little-noticed effect pervades our lives and seems to reach down to the deepest levels: if life goes beyond seeking material comfort, what else do we hope tomorrow will bring? What motivates us to enrich our minds and be different from chimpanzees?*
*No expertise necessary! Any readers over age fifteen will be able to see how this neglected topic sheds light on their personal lives and on the hopes and behavior of people at large."*
